The Guac that can't be stopped

Todo (in order by priority)
-------
- ~~Add a spawnable list to each zone object. Something like:~~
```
spawnables = {
  {
    behaviours = {"run", "", "", ""},
    spawnCount = 0,
    spawnMax = 3,
    spawnFreq = ...
    -- etc...
  },
  {
    -- more enemy types...
  }
}
```

- Fix camera player jittering (or find a new camera to use).

- Clean up the games appearance/add an animation library. Make it look more presentable.

- Either start implementing a levels.lua file or begin adding final game content (eg. enemy types/items/events).

- Anything else that might come up in the near future.
